"""Prove which functions of nfs3.exe can never run, and stub them.

Disassembles nfs3.exe as disassemble_nfs3hp.py does and computes what can be
reached, erring on the side of live everywhere:

roots
  - the entry point, every export, the generator's KNOWN_SUBROUTINES,
    THREAD_ROUTINES, MERGE_ROUTINES and SPLIT_INSTRUCTIONS
  - every function bound to a native (GAME_NATIVES) but the dead stubs: its
    x86 code counts as live, so whatever the original called, the native may
    call too
  - every address written anywhere in hand-written source: src/ (not the
    generated disassembly, not the DEAD lists), include/, tools/, decomp/,
    android/app/jni, cmake/, disasm/ and disassemble_nfs3hp.py
  - every pointer the image holds outside instructions: the value at each base
    relocation whose site no instruction covers, and every 4-byte window, at
    any alignment, of every section that is not code and of the code bytes
    that are no instruction (jump tables, data in the code)
edges, from a function to
  - every immediate and memory displacement of each of its instructions:
    direct calls, jumps, jcc, push offset, mov reg, offset, call [table]...
  - the vtables' and jump tables' destinations the disassembler resolved
  - the value at each relocation inside its instructions
  - the next function, when its last instruction can run on into it
An address counts for every function whose range [start, end) holds it, not
only the one it begins, and for the phony entries split out of that range.

A function nothing of that reaches can only be entered by an address computed
at run time from nothing in the image, which Watcom's code does not do.  Each
is a stub that stops the game with its address (src/nfs3hp/native_dead.inc,
native_dead.cpp), so if one is ever entered it says so instead of running.

The DEAD lists (native_dead.inc, native_snd_dead.inc,
native_graphics_dead.inc) are not roots.  Every run proves native_dead.inc
again and fails if one of it is reachable.  The other two stand on more than
references -- the plain mixer is in the game's tables, but the port's CPU has
MMX and they hand out the MMX set only -- so for them it only says how many it
proves from references alone; what they reach counts as live all the same.

Usage: tools/audit_dead.py [--write]   (from the repository root; needs capstone)
  --write  rewrite src/nfs3hp/native_dead.inc with every dead function that
           is still generated, and those already in it
