"""Whether sound_checks catches what it is there to catch.

    python3 tools/sound_checks/mutations.py [cases]

Each mutant runs on the export it touches and stops at the first case it gets
wrong; one that gets none wrong in `cases` (5000) is missed.

Builds sound_checks again and again, each time with one mistake put into a
copy of src/nfs3hp/native_isnd.cpp -- an argument read at the wrong time, a
byte written as a word, a check left out -- and expects it to fail.  Only the
mutant is compiled; the rest is linked from what tools/sound_checks/run.sh
built, so run that first.
