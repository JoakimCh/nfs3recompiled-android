/* The race's own sounds that play by themselves, rewritten (port.h says how):
 * the engines' sounds started in their slots as the race begins (the second
 * player's too in the split screen); a far-off effect of the crowd's bank
 * aimed by where the car is and played after a while; an effect of that bank
 * at random; the car bank's effect 15.
 *
 * Each plays through bankEffect (port_sound_effects.cpp) as the game's code
 * calls 0x4182b0.  That code reads esi and edi, which its callers here set
 * (a pan, a flag) for their own use and nobody for it, so these rewrites set
 * them the same way before each effect. */
