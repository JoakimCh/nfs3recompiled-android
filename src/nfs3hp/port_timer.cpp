/* EA's timer (the game's clock, cmn\timer.c), rewritten (port.h says how): a
 * thread of its own that Windows' multimedia timer wakes through an event,
 * once a tick, and that runs the functions registered with it -- up to eight;
 * the game registers one, the race's controls (raceload::raceControlsTick) --
 * and counts the game's tick (0x79c1a4) and the thread's own (0x79c1a0); the
 * multimedia timer's callback that sets the next shot, re-arming itself, and
 * wakes the thread and the sound thread; the start and stop of the whole.
 *
 * The state, from 0x79c16c: +0 the whole milliseconds counted, +4 the step of
 * a tick (16.16 milliseconds: 1000 / rate), +8 the multimedia timer's
 * resolution, +0xc the time the next tick is due, +0x10 the thread's event,
 * +0x14 its thread's slot, +0x28 the multimedia timer's id, +0x2c the fraction
 * of a millisecond left over, +0x30 whether the timer runs, +0x34 the thread's
 * ticks and +0x38 the game's tick.  The callbacks' table is at 0x79c130 (the
 * code reaches it from 0x79c12c), the rate the timer was started at is
 * 0x5643d8 (0 while it does not run -- the sound library asks for it), and the
 * function Error calls to stop the callbacks is 0x56441c.
 *
 * What the game's callers read of the registers: the registration's, nothing
 * past eax (they keep edx across it, which the code does); the start's two
 * callers, nothing; the thread, the callback and the clearing are entered
 * from Windows or Error, and read no result.  The thread's loop keeps the
 * code's edx, ebx and esi in locals, which the one function registered
 * (raceload::raceControlsTick) leaves alone.  Each is an adapter around a
 * core, as port.h has it.
 *
 * Not here: 0x48eef0, 0x48ef20 and 0x48ef30 -- a count of the callbacks and
 * the busy count's increment and decrement -- which nothing calls. */
