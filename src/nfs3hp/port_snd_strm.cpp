/* EA's SNDSTRM (cmn\sst.c, cmn\sstrstat.c) and the packet player under it
 * (cmn\spktplay.c), rewritten (port_snd.h says how): what plays a movie's
 * sound.  The movie's reader hands its chunks -- headers, data, loops, ends --
 * to a stream as requests; the stream's system task parses them, a header
 * starting the packet player on a voice, each data chunk submitted to it as a
 * packet the mixer plays; the packets played and done with are given back
 * through the stream's callbacks.
 *
 * The streams and the packet players stay in the game's memory (the mixer's
 * decoders take the packets from the players, the movie player reads the
 * streams' state); the records below say what is where.  Each function is
 * here as C++ with arguments and a result and, by the name the game's code
 * knows, as the adapter around it.
 *
 * What the code leaves in registers besides eax: only mul64's esi (its movsd
 * leaves it at a copy on its frame) is outside Watcom's rule that a function
 * may trash the registers it is handed arguments in (GAME_CHECKS_CLOBBERS=1
 * shows no other register changed), and the adapters give that back.  Of the
 * trashed ones they give back what is still seen: streamMemory's and
 * nextPacket's edx (the player), packetFramesPlayed's edx (the callback's),
 * which the mixer's decoders, native as the code is, carry up in their own
 * exits; the rest -- whatever the last call left in ebx, ecx and edx -- no
 * caller reads: the movie player calls the streams' entries from 0x495bc0,
 * whose only caller (0x4961b5) reads none of them, by the x86's liveness at
 * each call site followed through the returns; the rest of the callers are
 * the module's own. */
