/* The game's sound driver, eacsnd.dll, native and straight into SDL.
 *
 * eacsnd is the iSNDdirect* half of EA's SND library: the game (nfs3.exe) does
 * all the mixing -- the samples, the engine, the music stream, volume, pan and
 * pitch -- and the DLL only feeds what it mixes to DirectSound.  Its exports go
 * to the game through GetProcAddress (iSNDloaddll, pointers at 0x9ef61c..), and
 * of them only four do anything here -- this file's, which disassemble_nfs3hp.py
 * binds to the exports of those names, eacsnd having no generated code:
 *
 * - iSNDdirectcaps: the formats the card plays.  Ours plays stereo 16-bit at
 *   every rate, no 3D buffers: 0x3e08, as eacsnd worked out from our
 *   DirectSound.
 * - iSNDdirectstart(flags, window): the rate and format the game picked from
 *   those (22050 Hz, stereo, 16-bit).
 * - iSNDdirectserve: called by the game's sound thread (sub_48ec40), woken by
 *   its timer (sub_48ed30) and inside its critical section [0xa09b04].  eacsnd
 *   read DirectSound's play cursor, worked out how far ahead to write and had
 *   the game mix that much into the buffer: the mixer, the first function
 *   iSNDdirectsetfunctions was given ([0xa3c104], 0x4e1a24, stdcall buffer and
 *   frames), with the game's 100 Hz tick ([0xa3c114], 0x4e1adc) between every
 *   hundredth of a second of frames -- the clock MAD movies and SNDstreampurge
 *   ([0xa09afc]) keep time by.
 * - iSNDdirectstop.
 *
 * Here serve has the game mix into a buffer of guest memory of our own and puts
 * that on an SDL audio stream, which converts it to the phone's rate: no
 * DirectSound, no ring buffer for SDL's thread to copy out of.  How far ahead
 * it keeps the stream is eacsnd's 20 ms to begin with, or two of the device's
 * buffers where those are longer, raised by what the device found missing
 * whenever it ran dry -- serve on time, or late by a pause the game's sound
 * thread takes now and then, which the stream then has to bridge.
 *
 * eacsnd's twelve other exports -- the version, the game's functions,
 * recording, the 3D buffers -- are native in native_isnd.cpp.  With no 3D
 * buffers (caps) the game creates none, and vol, rate and pos3d only store what
 * they are given while eacsnd's DirectSound flag [0xa3c0b0] is 0, which nothing
 * here sets. */
