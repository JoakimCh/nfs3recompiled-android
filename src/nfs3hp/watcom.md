# The Watcom C runtime in nfs3.exe

nfs3.exe was linked with the C runtime of Watcom C/C++ 10.x/11.0. From
`0x4df600` on, the runtime's modules lie among EA's libraries -- its memory
manager, files, SND, NET, THRASH's loader, the vector maths -- in the order the
linker took them in, so no address range is the runtime's alone. This is a
map of all of it the game reaches: the 62 functions that the game's own code
and EA's call, everything those call in turn, and the start-up code -- 275
functions. Every other function from `0x4df600` on is EA's.

The names are Open Watcom's (`bld/clib`, `bld/mathlib` of
<https://github.com/open-watcom/open-watcom-v2>), the runtime's own
descendant: each named function was matched against its source there. "(internal)"
is a helper of the runtime not yet put a name to, listed with the family of
what calls it. The calls column counts the direct calls to it in the game's
code; the runtime's functions are also called through pointers, which it does
not count.

The port column says what the port has: `native` for a function of
`src/nfs3hp/native_watcom.cpp` (in `nfs3hp::watcom`, bound to the address by
`disassemble_nfs3hp.py`, `WATCOM_NATIVES`, and checked against the game's code
by `tools/game_checks`), `generated` for the game's own code.  All 275 are
native now.  What the runtime reaches only through pointers the start-up code
sets stays the game's code, outside this map: the x87's formatter
(`0x51f140`, `[__EFG_printf]`) and what `[__EFG_scanf]` points at, the
exception handler and filter `__InitExceptionHandling` installs (`0x51ef08`,
`0x51ed24`), the default `_matherr` (`0x52e3f8`), and the initializers and
finalizers the tables at `0x56b7de` and `0x56b81a` name.

## How it is called

Watcom's register convention: arguments in `eax`, `edx`, `ebx` and `ecx`, then
on the stack, which the callee clears; a result in `eax`, a floating-point one
in `st(0)`. A function keeps every register it is not handed an argument in;
those it is handed one in it may leave otherwise, and many do. The variadic
functions (`sprintf`, `fprintf`, `sscanf`) take everything on the stack, which
the caller clears. The runtime's helpers -- `__CHP`, `__STOSB`, `__GRO` and the
`IF@` maths cores -- have conventions of their own, given where they are native.

## Its data

| Address | What |
|---|---|
| `0x566f58` | `__iob`: 20 `FILE`s of `0x1a` bytes -- `stdin`, `stdout` (`0x566f72`), `stderr` (`0x566f8c`), `stdaux`, `stdprn`; a `FILE` is `_ptr`, `_cnt`, `_link`, `_flag`, `_handle`, `_bufsize`, then the bytes `_ungotten` and `_tmpfchar` |
| `0x9f38a0` | the open streams' list (`__OpenStreams`), `0x9f38a4` the closed ones': `__stream_link`s -- the next, the `FILE`, its buffer, its orientation (none, bytes, wide characters), its extended flags (`_COMMIT` 1) |
| `0x566f4c` | the near heap: `__nheapbeg`, `__MiniHeapRover` (`0x566f50`), `__LargestSizeB4MiniHeapRover` (`0x566f54`); `__MiniHeapFreeRover` at `0x9f3800`, `__nheap_clean` at `0xa0b140`; `__heap_enabled` at `0x56af68`, `_curbrk` at `0x5677f8`, `_amblksiz` at `0x56af6c` |
| `0x567764` | `__GetThreadPtr`: the thread's data -- `errno` at `+4`, `rand`'s seed at `+0xc`, `strtok`'s place at `+0x10`; the single thread's at `[0x9f642c]` |
| `0x567768`.. | the locks: the files' (`0x567768` taken, `0x56776c` given back, the handle in `eax`), the streams' (`0x567778`, `0x56777c`) and the heap's (`__NullAccessRtn` while there is one thread) |
| `0x56acbc` | the handles: `__OSHandles`, Windows' `HANDLE` for each, `__NHandles` of them at `0x56acc0`; `__NFiles` at `0x56ad94` (20); `__io_mode` at `0x56ade8`, a mode for each (`0x56ad98`'s 20); `_fmode` at `0x567164`, `_commode` at `0x568260`, the umask at `0x56ae60` |
| `0x5677b0` | the default windowing's hooks, none in the game: `_WindowsIsWindowedHandle`, `_WindowsStdin` (`0x5677d8`), `_WindowsStdout` (`0x5677dc`) |
| `0x567888` | `__set_errno_dos`'s `errno` for each of Windows' first 20 errors |
| `0x568b94` | the time zone: `timezone`; `daylight` at `0x568b98`, `__dst_adjust` at `0x568b9c`, `tzname[1]` at `0x568b90`; daylight saving's start and end rules at `0x568a40` and `0x568a64`, a `struct tm` each |
| `0x552148` | `__diyr` and `__dilyr` (`0x552162`): the days before each month, shorts |
| `0x564ef0` | `_IsTable`: a byte of flags a character, EOF first (`0x02` space, `0x20` digit) |
| `0x552140` | `_Bits`: 1, 2, 4 .. `0x80`, for the sets `__setbits` makes |
| `0x9f3810` | `atexit`'s 32 functions, their count at `0x9f3890` |
| `0x567858` | `__chipbug`, which `fpatan` is wrapped for |

### Formatted output

All native (`native_watcom.cpp`): `__prtf` walks the format and hands each
character to its caller's function -- `mem_putc` for `sprintf`, `file_putc`
for `fprintf` -- with the `SPECS` in its own frame; a float's conversion (e,
f, g) goes to `[0x56ac64]` (`__EFG_printf`, the x87's formatter the start-up
code puts there, `0x51f140`), which stays generated.

A stream's reading, writing and seeking are native, down to the handles'
`__qread`, `__qwrite` and `lseek`: `fputc`, `fputs` and `fwrite` into its
buffer, made by `__ioalloc` (after `__chktty`) the first time, and
`__flush`, `fflush` and `flushall` out of it, `fsync` after where the stream
is committed; `fgetc`, `fgets` and `fread` out of it, filled by
`__fill_buffer` -- by the console's `getche` for an unbuffered tty's handle
0; `fseek` within it where it can (`__update_buffer`)
and `ftell`.  Each keeps esp where its frame has it for what it calls, for
`__qread` and `__qwrite` hand Windows a dword of their own.  So are opening
and closing: `fopen` and `_fsopen` -- `__open_flags`, a stream from
`__allocfp`, `__doopen` -- and `_sopen`'s `CreateFileA` with
`SECURITY_ATTRIBUTES` and the rest of its frame as its code has them, the
handle from `__allocPOSIXHandle`; `fclose`, `__shutdown_stream`,
`__doclose` and `__close`.  `__allocPOSIXHandle` and `__freePOSIXHandle`
are called through `0x567770` and `0x567774`, jumps to them at `0x4ff0f8`
and `0x4ff100`; the handles' lock is at `0x567798` and `0x56779c`.  A
temporary file's name (`__MkTmpFile`, the directory, `getpid`) is still
the game's code, and `_nrealloc`, which grows `__OSHandles`.

The heap itself is in `src/nfs3hp/native_watcom_heap.cpp`, which voodoo2a's
heap, the same runtime's, shares; `native_watcom.cpp` binds the game's
functions to it. `_nmalloc` and `_nfree` are all the game's code and EA's
call; the rest are called only from these -- `_nheapshrink` also from
`0x51ea7c`, which closes the runtime's locks down at exit.

### x87 and math

| `0x52e400` | `__get_std_stream` |  | 1 | native |

The native ones are their instructions as the generated code has them: the
same operations of the port's x87, in the same order -- fldpi and fldl2e as
the doubles it loads -- so that they are its to the bit in either FPU.  So are
the Pentium FDIV bug's (`__fpatan_wrap`, while `__chipbug` says so: an atan2
of a table and a polynomial, each division through `0x526aeb` and
`0x5269d4`; its `fnsave` and `frstor` are not the generated code's either)
and a math error's report (`__reporterror` on: its `struct exception`,
`_matherr` through its pointer, the message to `stderr`, `errno`).

`sscanf` and `strtod` are native too (with the strings, above): `__scnf`
reads through the two routines in its specs (`cget_string` at `0x4f04f0` and
`uncget_string` at `0x4f051c`, sscanf's, native as well), and a float's
conversion gathers the number's text on its stack for `[__EFG_scanf]`;
`strtod`'s long double is built by `__ZBuf2LD` and scaled by
`__LDScale10x` on the x87.

`__tzset` and what it calls -- the zone from `TZ` (`0x515cbc`, `0x515c90`,
`0x515dd4`, `0x515ec2`) or from `GetTimeZoneInformation` (`0x515b34`), the
names by `wcstombs` (`0x5242f0`) -- are native too, written a push and a pop
at a time as their code is, `0x515ec2` going on in `__tzset`'s frame.
