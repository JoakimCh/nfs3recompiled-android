/* Watcom's near heap, as the runtime's code keeps it, on its variables in
 * guest memory (WatcomHeap): the game's -- whose functions native_watcom.cpp
 * binds -- and voodoo2a's, whose malloc and free THRASH_talloc and
 * THRASH_lockwindow take their records from, so they lie where voodoo2a's code
 * would have put them.  The two runtimes are Watcom 11's and have the same
 * heap; the game's takes the heap's lock around it, voodoo2a's would take its
 * own, a bare ret, which is not called here.
 *
 * The heap is a list of "miniheaps", each a block of VirtualAlloc'd memory
 * kept in the order of their addresses:
 *
 *   +0x00  length, the header's 0x2c and the closing -1 included
 *   +0x04  the miniheap before, +0x08 the one after
 *   +0x0c  the rover: the free block a search starts from
 *   +0x10  the largest free block before the rover
 *   +0x14  the largest free block
 *   +0x18  blocks in use, +0x1c free blocks
 *   +0x20  the free list's head: a length of 0, the last free block, the first
 *   +0x2c  the first block: a length, its bit 0 set while in use; a free
 *          block's previous and next free blocks follow it.  The last dword
 *          of the miniheap is -1. */
