/* What the game's side of DirectInput (native_controls_input.cpp) asks of the
 * port: each of its calls of DirectInput's, by the object it is made on and
 * the method's offset in that object's table of methods, its arguments where
 * the game's code pushes them -- on the stack, the object first, as stdcall.
 * The port answers them itself (native_controls_host.cpp), with its own pads,
 * mouse and keyboard and its force feedback: there is no DirectInput behind
 * them, and no object of it in the game's memory, only a handle the game
 * keeps where it kept the object.  tools/game_checks answers them as the
 * game's code made them, through the objects' tables, to hold the natives
 * against that code. */
