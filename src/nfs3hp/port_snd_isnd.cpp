/* eacsnd's twelve exports native_sound.cpp leaves: the version, the game's
 * functions, recording, and the 3D buffers -- the functions at the bottom,
 * which disassemble_nfs3hp.py binds to the exports of those names, eacsnd
 * having no generated code -- with eacsnd's own data in guest memory as the
 * one copy.  Rewritten (port.h says how): each is here as C++ with arguments
 * and a result (nfs3hp::port), and as the entry the game calls through the
 * stdcall pointer it keeps (nfs3hp, the names eacsnd exports).
 *
 * Each does what eacsnd's code does on the port: the same memory written in the
 * same order, the game's functions called with the same arguments at the same
 * stack addresses, the same result, the stack and ebx, esi, edi and ebp left as
 * a stdcall function leaves them.  The scratch registers and flags eacsnd
 * happened to leave are nobody's business: the game calls these through stdcall
 * pointers.
 *
 * Three of them call the game out (the 3D position, playing and stopping a
 * buffer), and these are eacsnd's own code to the register: esp, esi and the
 * saved registers are taken as the call out leaves them, not as a stdcall
 * callee would -- tools/sound_checks lets the game's functions move them, and
 * holds the result to eacsnd's -- so their cores run on the CPU (esp and esi
 * live) and leave esp and the registers as eacsnd does, the entry setting only
 * eax.  The rest take their arguments and give a result.
 *
 * eacsnd's other way, with DirectSound made (isnd::kDirectSoundMade) and 3D
 * buffers asked for (isnd::kIs3d), is not here: only eacsnd's start sets those,
 * and the port's start is native_sound.cpp's, which sets neither.  Should
 * either be set all the same, the core steps aside before it has done
 * anything (no answer), and the export fails (notNative).
 *
 * tools/sound_checks compares the sound* entries with eacsnd's generated code,
 * made afresh from the DLL, on random states. */
