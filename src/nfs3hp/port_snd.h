/* EA's SND library, rewritten (port.h says how): the voices the game plays
 * its sounds on, their volume, pan and pitch, the 100 Hz tick that moves
 * their envelopes, the platform layer that sets the mixer's channels for
 * them (port_snd_voices.cpp); and what a sound is played from -- banks,
 * patches, timbres -- and how a sample starts on a channel
 * (port_snd_play.cpp).  The mixer's own code, the streams and the driver are
 * still the register-level natives' (native_mixer.cpp, native_snd_*.cpp).
 *
 * Each of the library's functions is here twice: as C++ with arguments and a
 * result, which the rewrites call -- the game's sound effects among them --
 * and as the game's entry, by the name the game's code knows
 * (disassemble_nfs3hp.py binds its address to it), an adapter around the
 * first.  None of the game's callers reads more of what the library's code
 * leaves than eax (tools/game_checks holds the adapters to Watcom's
 * convention), so each rewrite gives back only its result.
 *
 * The records stay where the game has them while the game's code shares
 * them -- the mixer reads the channels, the streams the voices -- and are
 * read and written in place. */
